    Objective

    Be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either
    vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).

    How to play

    Red goes first in the first game.
    Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn.
    The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
    The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.
